Respiratory Rate: 16/min

LABORATORY RESULTS
==================
Lipid Panel:
  Total Cholesterol: 245 mg/dL
  LDL Cholesterol: 168 mg/dL
  HDL Cholesterol: 42 mg/dL
  Triglycerides: 198 mg/dL

Metabolic Panel:
  Fasting Blood Glucose: 118 mg/dL
  HbA1c: 6.2%

ECHOCARDIOGRAM FINDINGS
========================
Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction (LVEF): 54%
Left Atrial Size: Mildly enlarged
Mitral Valve: Mild regurgitation
Tricuspid Valve: Trace regurgitation
Aortic Valve: Normal function
PASP: 38 mmHg (estimated)

ELECTROCARDIOGRAM (ECG)
========================
Rhythm: Normal sinus rhythm
Rate: 88 bpm
Axis: Normal
Intervals: Within normal limits
ST-T Changes: Non-specific ST changes in lateral leads

RISK FACTORS
============
✓ Hypertension (Stage 2)
✓ Obesity (Class I)
✓ Dyslipidemia
✓ Pre-diabetes
✓ Sedentary lifestyle
✓ Family history of CAD (father, age 58)

ASSESSMENT
==========
1. Stage 2 Hypertension requiring pharmacological intervention
2. Obesity Class I (BMI 30.1) with abdominal obesity
3. Dyslipidemia with elevated LDL and low HDL
4. Pre-diabetes (impaired fasting glucose)
5. Mild mitral regurgitation
6. Multiple cardiovascular risk factors present

RECOMMENDATIONS
===============
1. URGENT: Start antihypertensive therapy (ACE inhibitor or ARB)
2. Initiate statin therapy for dyslipidemia (target LDL <100)
3. Weight management: Target 10% weight loss (8.2 kg reduction)
4. Consider GLP-1RA medication for weight management and glycemic control
5. Lifestyle modifications:
   - DASH or Mediterranean diet
   - 150 minutes/week moderate-intensity aerobic exercise
   - Sodium restriction (<2000mg/day)
   - Limit alcohol consumption
6. Follow-up labs in 3 months (lipid panel, glucose, HbA1c)
7. Repeat echocardiogram in 12 months
8. Cardiology consultation recommended within 2-4 weeks
9. Consider sleep apnea screening given obesity and hypertension

FOLLOW-UP
=========
- Primary care: 2 weeks
- Cardiology: 2-4 weeks
- Repeat labs: 3 months
- Repeat echo: 12 months

PHYSICIAN NOTES
===============
This 52-year-old female presents with multiple cardiovascular risk factors 
including obesity, hypertension, and dyslipidemia. The combination of 
abdominal obesity (waist 98cm) and metabolic abnormalities significantly 
increases her 10-year cardiovascular event risk. Aggressive risk factor 
modification is essential. Weight loss of even 5-10% would provide substantial 
cardiovascular benefit including blood pressure reduction and improved lipid 
profile. Patient is counseled on lifestyle modifications and pharmacotherapy 
options.
